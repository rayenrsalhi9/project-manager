  - Completion confirmation checkbox
  - Optional notes/comments field
- **Validation**: Implement client-side validation for required fields
- **Progress Indicators**: Add upload progress bars and form validation states

#### Admin Review Process
- **Submission Dashboard**: Admin interface to review all pending submissions
- **Review Criteria**:

  - File/document quality assessment
  - Deadline compliance checking
  - Optional feedback/comment system
- **Decision Actions**:
  - **Accept**: Mark task as completed, update project progress
  - **Reject**: Return task with feedback, reset to in_progress status
  - **Request Changes**: Partial approval with modification requests

#### Status Transitions
- **Successful Submission Flow**:
  1. User submits completed task
  2. Admin receives notification of new submission
  3. Admin reviews and accepts/rejects
  4. Task status updates to "finished" or remains "in_progress"
  5. Project progress recalculates automatically

- **Rejection Scenarios**:
  - **Incomplete Work**: Missing required deliverables
  - **Quality Issues**: Substandard work quality
  - **Deadline Issues**: Late submissions requiring special handling
  - **Technical Issues**: File corruption or format problems

- **Automatic Status Updates**:
  - Tasks marked as "finished" upon admin acceptance
  - Tasks remain "in_progress" if rejected or requiring changes
  - Deadline extensions handled through admin interface
  - Progress metrics update in real-time

## 🚀 Next Steps: Task Submission Implementation

### Current Status
The task submission system is partially implemented with:
- ✅ Notification system for task assignments
- ✅ Task details view with deadline tracking
- ⚠️ Basic submission form structure (under development)
- ❌ File upload functionality
- ❌ Admin review workflow

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. User Submission Workflow
**Phase 1: Core Submission Features**
- **File Upload System**: Multi-file upload with drag-and-drop support
- **Rich Text Editor**: Description field with formatting options
- **Validation**: Required fields, file type/size validation, deadline checks
- **Progress Indicators**: Upload progress, form validation states
- **Auto-save**: Draft preservation during submission process

**Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience**
- **Submission History**: Track all user submissions with timestamps
- **Resubmission**: Allow updates before deadline
- **Preview Mode**: Review submission before finalizing
- **Confirmation**: Success/error notifications with clear feedback

#### 2. Admin Review Process

**Review Dashboard**
- **Submission Queue**: Filterable list of pending submissions
- **Quick Actions**: Accept/Reject with reason codes
- **Bulk Operations**: Process multiple submissions efficiently
- **Review History**: Track admin decisions and feedback

**Acceptance Criteria**
- **Quality Standards**: Check for completeness and accuracy
- **Deadline Compliance**: Ensure submissions meet deadlines
- **File Validation**: Verify file formats and content
- **Requirements Met**: Confirm all task requirements are addressed

**Rejection Scenarios**
- **Incomplete Submissions**: Missing required elements
- **Late Submissions**: Past deadline submissions
- **Quality Issues**: Poor quality or incorrect content
- **Technical Problems**: File corruption or format issues
- **Resubmission Requests**: Allow users to address feedback

#### 3. Status Transitions

**Task Status Flow**
```
assigned → in_progress → submitted → reviewed → finished
                    ↓           ↓
                overdue    rejected → in_progress (resubmission)
```

**Status Management**
- **Automatic Updates**: Status changes based on deadlines and actions
- **Manual Overrides**: Admins can adjust statuses when needed
- **History Tracking**: Log all status changes with reasons
- **Notifications**: Alert users and admins of status changes

**Completion Logic**
- **Successful Submission**: Task marked as finished after acceptance
- **Rejection Handling**: Task returns to in_progress with feedback
- **Deadline Management**: Automatic overdue status updates
- **Completion Rates**: Track and display project completion statistics

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Schema**: Extend tasks table with submission fields
- **File Storage**: Supabase storage for submission files
- **API Endpoints**: New endpoints for submission and review operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates using Supabase subscriptions
- **Security**: File upload validation, access control, data sanitization

### Supabase Integration
The application uses Supabase for:
• User authentication and session management
• Project and task data storage
• Real-time subscriptions for live updates
• User profile management

### OpenAI Integration
AI-powered features include:
• Task generation from project descriptions
• Natural language processing for project planning
• Automated task suggestions based on project context

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
• Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
• Check TypeScript configuration files
• Verify environment variables are properly set

**Authentication Issues**
• Verify Supabase credentials in environment variables
• Check network connectivity to Supabase
• Ensure user has proper permissions

**AI Service Issues**
• Verify OpenAI API key is valid
• Check API rate limits and usage
• Ensure base URL is correctly configured
